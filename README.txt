To run the program with the test file type the following command:
	java SudokuValidator solution.txt results.txt

To run the program with any other file simply replace {file_name} with a file name. The program will automatically create a new results file if one does not exist, but will require a sudoku solution file to be provided. Otherwise, the program will crash. Both a sudoku txt file and a results txt file MUST be specified.
	java SudokuValidator {file_name} {file_name}

To view the results of the program, simply run:
	cat results.txt
or whatever you named your results file in the previous command lines.
